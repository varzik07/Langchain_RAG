    "## Reranking Hybrid Search Strategies\n",
    "Re-ranking is a second-stage filtering process in retrieval systems in RAG pipelines where we:\n",
    "- 1- First use a fast retriever (like BM25, FAISS, hybrid) to fetch top-k documents quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2- Then use a more accurate but slower model (like a cross-encoder or LLM) to re-score and reorder those documents by relevance to the query\n",
    "\n",
    "it ensure that the most relevant documents appear at top, improving the final answer from the LLM"
