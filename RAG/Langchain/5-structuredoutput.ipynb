       "AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking about the movie \"House of the Ashes.\" Let me start by checking if that\\'s the correct title. Sometimes people mix up titles, so maybe it\\'s a typo. Wait, \"House of the Ashes\" doesn\\'t ring a bell. Let me think. There\\'s a movie called \"House of the Dead,\" but that\\'s different. Maybe they meant \"House of the Dragon,\" but that\\'s a TV series. Or perhaps \"House of the Spirits,\" which is a well-known film. Alternatively, maybe it\\'s \"The House of the Flying Daggers,\" a wuxia film. Let me verify.\\n\\nI should consider possible misspellings. \"Ashes\" could be part of a different title. Let me search my knowledge base for movies with \"Ashes\" in the title. There\\'s \"The Ashes\" (2016), but that\\'s a documentary. \"Ashes and Snow\" is a film, but it\\'s not widely known. Maybe the user is referring to a different title altogether. Wait, \"Ashes to Ashes\" is a TV series. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it\\'s \"House of Ashes,\" but I don\\'t recall a movie by that name.\\n\\nAlternatively, the user might be referring to a different movie they\\'re confused about. Let me check if there\\'s any recent movie with that title. No, I don\\'t think so. Perhaps they\\'re thinking of a book or a TV show that\\'s been adapted but not released yet. Alternatively, maybe it\\'s a mix-up between titles. For example, \"House of the Dragon\" is a TV series, but if someone says \"House of the Ashes,\" they might be conflating the two.\\n\\nWait, maybe the user is referring to \"House of the Dragon\" and mistakenly wrote \"Ashes.\" Let me check the details of \"House of the Dragon.\" It\\'s a prequel to \"Game of Thrones,\" set in Westeros, focusing on the Targaryen family. The title \"House of the Dragon\" makes sense, but the user wrote \"House of the Ashes.\" Maybe they meant \"House of the Dragon.\" Alternatively, perhaps they\\'re referring to a different production.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe they\\'re thinking of \"House of the Dragon\" and got confused with the title. Let me check if there\\'s a movie called \"House of the Ashes.\" A quick search in my memory: no, I don\\'t recall a movie with that exact title. However, there\\'s a TV series called \"House of the Dragon,\" which is a prequel to \"Game of Thrones.\" The user might have a typo. Alternatively, maybe they\\'re referring to a different franchise.\\n\\nAnother angle: maybe \"House of the Ashes\" is a lesser-known film. Let me think. There\\'s \"House of the Damned\" (2001), but that\\'s a horror movie. \"House of the Rising Sun\" is a musical. \"House of the Wolfman\" is another horror film. Not matching \"Ashes.\" Alternatively, maybe it\\'s a foreign film. For example, \"La Casa de los Espíritus\" is \"House of the Spirits,\" a Chilean film. But the user wrote \"Ashes,\" not \"Spirits.\"\\n\\nWait, perhaps the user is referring to a movie that\\'s part of a series. For example, \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" has a scene with the house of Bree, but that\\'s not relevant. Alternatively, \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\" has a house, but not \"Ashes.\"\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe they\\'re referring to a movie that\\'s not widely known. Let me consider if there\\'s a movie called \"House of the Ashes\" that I\\'m not aware of. If I can\\'t find it, perhaps the correct title is different, and I should inform the user that there might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it\\'s a mix-up with \"House of the Dragon\" or \"House of the Spirits.\"\\n\\nIn conclusion, since I can\\'t find a movie titled \"House of the Ashes,\" I should ask the user to confirm the title. However, if they meant \"House of the Dragon,\" I can provide information on that. Alternatively, if they meant \"House of the Spirits,\" I can give details on that. Let me check if there\\'s any other possible movie. For example, \"House of Ashes\" might be a documentary or a film from a specific country. Still, I can\\'t recall any. Therefore, the best approach is to inform the user that the title might be incorrect and offer assistance if they meant a different movie.\\n</think>\\n\\nIt seems there might be a mix-up in the title you\\'re referring to. After a thorough check, there is **no widely known movie titled \"House of the Ashes.\"** However, here are a few possibilities based on similar-sounding titles or potential typos:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. **House of the Dragon** (2022–)  \\n   - **Type**: TV Series (prequel to *Game of Thrones*)  \\n   - **Genre**: Fantasy, Drama, History  \\n   - **Plot**: Set 300 years before the events of *Game of Thrones*, it chronicles the Targaryen dynasty\\'s rise and fall, focusing on the tumultuous relationship between siblings Viserys and Rhaenyra.  \\n   - **Streaming**: Available on **HBO Max** (in the U.S.) and **HBO** internationally.  \\n   - **Details**: Created by George R.R. Martin, it explores political intrigue, power struggles, and the infamous \"Dance of the Dragons\" civil war.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. **House of the Spirits** (1993)  \\n   - **Type**: Feature Film  \\n   - **Genre**: Drama, Magical Realism  \\n   - **Plot**: Based on Isabel Allende’s novel, this Chilean film follows the multi-generational story of the Trueba family, blending personal and political histories with magical elements.  \\n   - **Director**: Bille August  \\n   - **Notable Cast**: Jessica Lange, Meryl Streep, and Antonio Banderas.  \\n   - **Themes**: Feminism, political oppression, and the resilience of family.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. **Other Possibilities**  \\n   - **House of the Dead** (2003): A horror-comedy based on the video game.  \\n   - **House of the Dragon**: As above, a popular prequel to *Game of Thrones*.  \\n   - **Ashes to Ashes** (2008–2012): A British crime drama series.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### If You Meant a Different Title:\\n- **Typos?** If you meant *House of the Dragon* or *House of the Spirits*, I can provide more details.  \\n- **Foreign Films?** Let me know if you’re referring to a non-English production (e.g., \"La Casa de los Gritos\" or \"La Maison en Feu\").  \\n\\nLet me know how you\\'d like to proceed! 😊', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1484, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 1504, 'completion_time': 3.118625939, 'prompt_time': 0.000584261, 'queue_time': 0.046854669, 'total_time': 3.1192102}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c843d-94e3-7c72-8153-1063296ebbf2-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 20, 'output_tokens': 1484, 'total_tokens': 1504})"
